	<h1> All About Bears </h1>
	<br/>
	<p> Bears are very scary. Comparable to my mother with a belt. </p>
	<p> The teddy bear is not an actual bear. It is made up, like all of my friends. </p>
	<p> Bears like to eat sardines, but not the canned ones. </p>
	<p> Bears like to hibernate in the winter, sleeping for up to three months. My father has been hibernating for 12 years. He still hasn't returned. </p>
